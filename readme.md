# ‘Don't Make Me Feel Stupid’ – A. User #

If every developer had read Alan Cooper’s book, ‘The Inmates are Running the Asylum’, we would have a lot less crappy software in the world.  Fact!

In this UX orientated talk we’ll focus on how anything we design, physical or software, should not cause the user to be made to feel stupid.  It’s a simple rule and yet frequently ignored.

This will be a subjective look at UX, from poor design in the physical environment, to some of the common pitfalls developers encounter and that can be easily avoided once you consider how the end users will interact with your software.

You won’t leave the session being a UX expert (I’m not one either) and none of this will bring about world peace, but it sure would improve a lot of people’s lives when they interact with your software.
